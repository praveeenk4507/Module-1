**Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Finding Speed of a Car**

**AIM**

To write a Python program to find the speed of a car based on the given distance (in kilometers) and time (in hours).

**ALGORITHM**

1. Start the program.
2. Read the distance covered by the car from the user and convert it to a float.
3. Read the time taken from the user and convert it to a float.
4. Calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time.
5. Format the result to two decimal places and print it along with appropriate units.
6. End the program.
