**Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Two Numbers**

**AIM** 

To write a Python program to find the minimum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

**ALGORITHM**
1. Start the program.
2. Read two float numbers from the user using input() and convert them using float().
3. Use a conditional expression (ternary operator) to find the minimum value.
4. Print the result using f-string formatting.
5. End the program.

a=float(input())
b=float(input())
min=a if a<b else b
print(f"The minimum of {a} and {b} is {min}")
