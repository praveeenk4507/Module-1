**Experiment No: 1d – Conditional Statements- Conditional Statements – Check Divisibility by 5 and 9**

**AIM**

To write a Python program to read a number and check whether it is divisible by both 5 and 9 using if-else statement.


**ALGORITHM**  

1. Start the program.
2.Read an integer from the user using input() and convert it to int.
3. Use the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by both 5 and 9.
4. If divisible by both, print that the number is divisible by both 5 and 9.
5. Otherwise, print that it is not divisible by both 5 and 9.
6. End the program.

**PROGRAM**

a=int(input())
if(a%5==0 and a%9==0):
    print("{} is divisible by both 5 and 9".format(a))
else:
    print("{} is NOT divisible by both 5 and 9".format(a))

**RESULT**

Thus the program to read a number and check whether it is divisible by both 5 and 9 using if-else statement has been implemented and executed succssfully.
